Finally, our season of soft topics is ending. This is our last topic, and it is Open Government.

# Open Government

The main idea behind the open government theme is transparency. The ideal of an open government talks about the opening of information and activities of the state, in a free, accessible, understandable way and that meets the basic standard of open data. Technology, the internet, the different devices are helping this task by reducing the bridge between state institutions and citizens, whether through data dissemination portals or opinion polls between different applications.

If we look closely at the concept of an open government, of open knowledge (Open Knowledge), we will come across a very famous knowledge in the world of software development and very defended in universities, as well as in the IME, free software (Free Software)). Here both, institution and developer, seek through knowledge sharing and collective work to gain the trust of the target population. The ideal of opening government data and software with open source to the community come together in an objective of achieving the transparency of the entire process present there.

Considering the data provided in Fernanda Campagnucci's lecture, it is clear that the state machine is moving in the right direction, with small steps, but we observe that there is already a change in course, that at least we are going in the right direction. Every day, more data is opened by the government on open source platforms, thus adding yet another certificate of transparency of the project proposed there. Another view that we can add to the argument is that defended by the Public Code (publiccode.eu), where the main idea revolves around that if the software was built using taxpayer money, if it was financed by the public machine, why not this knowledge? What was generated there shouldn't belong to all the citizens who helped to finance that project?

But we are still a long way from an ideal situation. We need a way to inform the population of much more data in a way, as already mentioned, accessible and understandable. If we take the example of consultation platforms, open source is a very positive quality, it becomes a great proof of transparency. We still need more collaborative transparency, cross-platform and cross-data. We need, as shown in the lecture, to base ourselves on four concepts, technology, transparency, responsibility and participation/collaboration. Still talking about user interaction (citizen), platform (state), there are three levels of participation, we have infrastructure (open source), metacim (decisions on how to make decisions) and proposals on the platform (end users).

Finally, with the help of the lecture, a new panorama was opened in relation to Free software and Open Knowledge, which is recent, since even the very idea of Free Software has been popularized in much less time, if we remember the beginning of computing , everything revolved around big software from big companies, closed, a real black box. But with more and more governments supporting new organizations that strive to improve openness of government and the use of open repositories like Github shows that we hit the right path in the right direction early on, it's worth not to be fooled by the speed at which computing is advancing. , its history is still very recent.
