A professional programmer who has graduated from a university and someone who has taught themselves programming online both possess unique skills and experiences that make them valuable in the field of software development. However, there are distinct differences between the two that should be considered when evaluating their qualifications and abilities.

## Why you should study programming on a university

One of the main differences between a university-educated programmer and an online self-taught programmer is the depth and breadth of their knowledge. A university-educated programmer will have a comprehensive understanding of computer science principles and programming languages, as well as experience in applying this knowledge to real-world problems. An online self-taught programmer, on the other hand, may have a more limited understanding of these concepts and may have less experience in applying them to real-world scenarios.

Another significant difference is the level of critical thinking and problem solving skills. A university-educated programmer will have been trained to analyze and solve complex problems using a systematic and logical approach. They will have been exposed to a wide range of programming languages, paradigms and techniques, and will be able to apply them to different scenarios. An online self-taught programmer, on the other hand, may have a more narrow focus, having only been exposed to the languages and techniques they have taught themselves.

Moreover, university-educated programmers are more likely to have experience working in a team and collaborating on projects. In a university setting, students often work on group projects and have the opportunity to learn how to communicate effectively and work well with others. This is critical when working on software development projects, as they are usually complex and require the contributions of multiple people. On the other hand, an online self-taught programmer may have less experience working with others and may find it more difficult to effectively collaborate on projects.

Universities also provide a more structured and formal learning environment. University programs are designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of computer science principles and programming languages. They also provide students with hands-on experience, through which students can apply their knowledge to real-world problems. This is in contrast to the online self-taught programmer, who may have a more informal and unstructured learning experience.

Additionally, university-educated programmers are more likely to have a degree or certification that attests to their qualifications. This can be useful when looking for employment or when trying to advance in their careers. Having a degree or certification can demonstrate to employers that the programmer has a certain level of knowledge and experience.

On the other hand, self-taught programmers have the advantage of being more adaptable and able to learn new technologies quickly. They are not limited by a specific curriculum and can explore new technologies and programming languages on their own terms. This can be especially valuable in a field that is constantly evolving and changing. They also tend to be more autonomous and self-directed, which can be beneficial for those who prefer to work independently.

It is also important to note that both university-educated programmers and online self-taught programmers can be successful in their careers. It ultimately depends on the individual's drive, passion, and willingness to continue learning and growing as a programmer.

In conclusion, while both university-educated programmers and online self-taught programmers possess unique skills and experiences, university education provides a more comprehensive understanding of computer science principles and programming languages. It also provides hands-on experience, and a structured and formal learning environment. Additionally, a university degree or certification can demonstrate to employers that the programmer has a certain level of knowledge and experience. However, self-taught programmers have the advantage of being more adaptable, autonomous, and able to learn new technologies quickly. Therefore, it is not a matter of one being better than the other, but rather understanding the strengths and limitations of each and how they can complement each other in a professional setting.
