Yet another different common post, now we are going to talk about Internet Consumer.

# Internet Consumer

The Brazilian judicial system is very complex and extensive and this creates a fundamental problem about the laws: people do not know them. Thus, one of the branches of the problem is the consumer's right in relation to a product or service. The consumer does not know his rights, he knows even less where to complain about them and, even less, how to argue to defend what he believes to be his right. With this, bodies such as IDEC are of extreme importance, it defends the consumer before companies with the mission of, citing speaker Barbara Simão, promoting education, awareness and defense of consumer rights and ethics in consumer relations with total political and economic indecency.

Talking a little more about IDEC, we can say that the agency does “advocacy”, where, according to the lecture, the activities consist of mobilizing the population, conducting research, guidance, monitoring laws, public hearings, Civil and public bodies, make up regulatory agencies, carry out public consultations and position papers. The idea of bodies with the IDEC and regulating the market to ensure that consumers' rights are being fulfilled is an old one and comes from laws and organizations such as the Meat Inspection Act of 1906, Food Law and Medicines of 1906 as well and the Federal Trade Commission of 1914. As also proposed by John F. Kennedy on March 15, 1962 the right to safety, information, choice and to be heard.

In 1990, the Consumer Protection Code, also known as the CDC, was created, which ensures the protection of life, health, safety, education, dissemination of appropriate consumption, information adequate and clear, protection against misleading and abusive advertising, prevention and repair of damages, access to judicial and administrative bodies, facilitation of the defense of rights, such as the reversal of the burden of proof and the modification of disproportionate contractual clauses. Still from this point of view, the consumer has rights over the consumption-related data that companies collect about him. And to protect the consumer, we made small but steady steps forward, such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970, the Consumer Protection Code of 1990, the Positive Registry Act of 2011 and its reform in 2019.

Anyway, we have already achieved a lot, but the road is still long and we need to fight for rights like the credit score carried out by companies, telemarketing, robocalls and things like targeted advertising and facial recognition after all these technologies are being used to understand consumer behavior to influence it in a subtle way, as, for example, we have already seen it happen in other areas, such as the election of current President Trump of the United States and Brexit in England. We even have an example in Brazil, where ViaQuatro, which operates one of the metro lines in São Paulo, used small cameras on its panels to track the facial expressions of people watching the advertisements present there, but it was removed with the action of the IDEC. For these examples, and many others, we must fight so that more and more bodies and laws are created to defend our rights because millionaire companies can act in such subtle ways that it is impossible for the average consumer to identify before be too late.
