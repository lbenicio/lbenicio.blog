GPUs idled waiting for models to load, autoscalers fought each other, and on-call engineers reheated leftovers at 3 a.m. while spike traffic slammed into origin. We promised leadership that this would never happen again. The solution wasn&amp;rsquo;t magic; it was a self-healing inference platform blending old-school reliability, modern ML tooling, and relentless experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post documents the rebuild. We&amp;rsquo;ll explore model packaging, warm-up rituals, adaptive scheduling, observability, chaos drills, and the social contract between ML researchers and production engineers. The goal: keep models awake, snappy, and trustworthy even when the world throws curveballs.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
