But learned indexes aren’t a gimmick. They exploit a simple observation: real data isn’t uniformly random. It has shape—monotonic keys, skewed distributions, natural clusters—and a model can learn that shape to predict where a key lives in a sorted array. The payoff is smaller indexes, fewer cache misses, and—sometimes—dramatically faster lookups.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Tuning the Dial: Adaptive Consistency at Planet Scale</title><link>https://lbenicio.dev/blog/tuning-the-dial-adaptive-consistency-at-planet-scale/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Mar 2020 14:05:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lbenicio.dev/blog/tuning-the-dial-adaptive-consistency-at-planet-scale/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;At 2:17 a.m. UTC, a partner bank in Singapore called our incident bridge. A fund transfer appeared twice in their ledger. The culprit: a replication lag spike between Singapore and Frankfurt had stretched past our standard safety buffers. Historically we would have halted writes across the fleet, cutting availability to protect consistency. Instead, our adaptive consistency layer dialed a region-specific policy: Singapore moved from &amp;ldquo;read-after-write&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;read-your-writes&amp;rdquo; guarantees, while Frankfurt raised its commit quorum. The double posting self-corrected before social media noticed. No downtime, no irreversible loss—just a story about how we learned to treat consistency as a spectrum rather than a binary.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Database System Concepts (7th ed.)</title><link>https://lbenicio.dev/reading/database-system-concepts-7th-ed./</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lbenicio.dev/reading/database-system-concepts-7th-ed./</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Foundational text on database design, SQL, normalization, transactions, and architectures.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Database System Concepts (7th ed.)</title><link>https://lbenicio.dev/reading/database-system-concepts-7th-ed./</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lbenicio.dev/reading/database-system-concepts-7th-ed./</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Foundational text on database design, SQL, transactions, and architectures.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Principles of Database and Knowledge-Base Systems</title><link>https://lbenicio.dev/reading/principles-of-database-and-knowledge-base-systems/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lbenicio.dev/reading/principles-of-database-and-knowledge-base-systems/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Foundational theory for databases and knowledge-base systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
