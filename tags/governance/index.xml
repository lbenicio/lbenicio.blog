Our models influenced credit decisions, hiring suggestions, and medical triage. Stakeholders demanded more than accuracy—they wanted fairness, explainability, and accountability. We responded by building a responsible AI audit pipeline woven into development, deployment, and operations. This article shares how we did it: the processes, tooling, and cultural shifts that turned compliance into continuous curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Sealing the Supply Chain: Zero-Trust Build Pipelines That Scale</title><link>https://lbenicio.dev/blog/sealing-the-supply-chain-zero-trust-build-pipelines-that-scale/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Oct 2023 21:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lbenicio.dev/blog/sealing-the-supply-chain-zero-trust-build-pipelines-that-scale/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The day we discovered a compromised dependency in our build pipeline felt like waking up to find the locks on our headquarters replaced. The package arrived through a trusted mirror, signed with a familiar key, yet embedded a subtle time bomb. We escaped without production impact thanks to layered defenses, but the scare pushed us to redesign our build system around zero trust. This article chronicles that transformation—technical and human—from ad hoc pipelines to hermetic, verifiable, auditable delivery.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
