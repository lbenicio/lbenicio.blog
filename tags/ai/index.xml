Our models influenced credit decisions, hiring suggestions, and medical triage. Stakeholders demanded more than accuracyâ€”they wanted fairness, explainability, and accountability. We responded by building a responsible AI audit pipeline woven into development, deployment, and operations. This article shares how we did it: the processes, tooling, and cultural shifts that turned compliance into continuous curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Seeing in the Dark: Observability for Edge AI Fleets</title><link>https://lbenicio.dev/blog/seeing-in-the-dark-observability-for-edge-ai-fleets/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2024 10:55:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lbenicio.dev/blog/seeing-in-the-dark-observability-for-edge-ai-fleets/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Our edge AI deployment began with a handful of pilot devices in retail stores. Within months, thousands of cameras, sensors, and point-of-sale terminals joined the fleet. They detected shelves running low, predicted queue lengths, and flagged suspicious transactions. But when a customer called asking why a device misclassified bananas as tennis balls, we realized our observability blurred at the edge. Logs vanished into the ether, metrics arrived sporadically, and models drifted silently. This article shares how we built observability robust enough for flaky networks, sensitive data, and autonomous updates.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (4th ed.)</title><link>https://lbenicio.dev/reading/artificial-intelligence-a-modern-approach-4th-ed./</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lbenicio.dev/reading/artificial-intelligence-a-modern-approach-4th-ed./</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Definitive textbook on AI covering search, knowledge, planning, learning, and applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (4th ed.)</title><link>https://lbenicio.dev/reading/artificial-intelligence-a-modern-approach-4th-ed./</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lbenicio.dev/reading/artificial-intelligence-a-modern-approach-4th-ed./</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Definitive AI textbook covering search, knowledge, planning, learning, and applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Deep Learning</title><link>https://lbenicio.dev/reading/deep-learning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lbenicio.dev/reading/deep-learning/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Comprehensive textbook on deep learning theory and practice.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems</title><link>https://lbenicio.dev/reading/probabilistic-reasoning-in-intelligent-systems/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lbenicio.dev/reading/probabilistic-reasoning-in-intelligent-systems/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A seminal work on Bayesian networks and probabilistic reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
