Customers trusted us with near-infinite elasticity. Flipping servers into deep power states to save energy sounded like penny-pinching, not engineering. Yet the math was undeniable: idling a hyperscale fleet burned as much electricity as a mid-size city. This post tells the story of how we evolved from skepticism to confidence, building energy-aware scheduling systems that keep promises while honoring planetary limits.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
