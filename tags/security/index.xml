Quantum computers capable of breaking RSA-2048 remain years away, but data harvested today could be decrypted decades later. We handle sensitive customer contracts, healthcare records, and government workloads. Waiting for the quantum threat to manifest felt irresponsible. So we embarked on a multi-year migration to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). This post documents the journey—strategy, tooling, experiments, and the human moments that kept the program afloat.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Sealing the Supply Chain: Zero-Trust Build Pipelines That Scale</title><link>https://lbenicio.dev/blog/sealing-the-supply-chain-zero-trust-build-pipelines-that-scale/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Oct 2023 21:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lbenicio.dev/blog/sealing-the-supply-chain-zero-trust-build-pipelines-that-scale/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The day we discovered a compromised dependency in our build pipeline felt like waking up to find the locks on our headquarters replaced. The package arrived through a trusted mirror, signed with a familiar key, yet embedded a subtle time bomb. We escaped without production impact thanks to layered defenses, but the scare pushed us to redesign our build system around zero trust. This article chronicles that transformation—technical and human—from ad hoc pipelines to hermetic, verifiable, auditable delivery.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Security Engineering (3rd ed.)</title><link>https://lbenicio.dev/reading/security-engineering-3rd-ed./</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lbenicio.dev/reading/security-engineering-3rd-ed./</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;An encyclopedic treatment of security engineering principles, attacks, and defenses.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
