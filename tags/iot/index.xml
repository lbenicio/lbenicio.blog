Within months, thousands of cameras, sensors, and point-of-sale terminals joined the fleet. They detected shelves running low, predicted queue lengths, and flagged suspicious transactions. But when a customer called asking why a device misclassified bananas as tennis balls, we realized our observability blurred at the edge. Logs vanished into the ether, metrics arrived sporadically, and models drifted silently. This article shares how we built observability robust enough for flaky networks, sensitive data, and autonomous updates.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
