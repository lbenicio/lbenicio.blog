# Evolution and Future Trends in Computation and Algorithms

The computational world is an ever-evolving sphere that has been influencing the course of human progress for decades now. The classics of computation and algorithms have laid the foundation for this spectacular growth while the new trends signify the path towards a future powered by sophisticated technology. This article aims to delve into a comprehensive review of both these aspects, drawing a trajectory from the past to the future, all the while maintaining an academic discourse.

The bedrock of computational science was laid by the likes of **Charles Babbage** and **Ada Lovelace** with their analytical engine in the 19th Century. The advent of the 20th Century saw the development of mechanical computers, marking the first generation of computing. These machines such as the Atanasoff-Berry Computer and ENIAC used vacuum tubes for circuitry and magnetic drums for memory. Their introduction was transformative, marking the beginning of the computer age.

**Alan Turing's** universal machine laid the groundwork for the theory of computation. Turing's work on algorithms and computation, particularly the idea of a universal Turing machine, forms the basis of the modern theory of computation. **Claude Shannon's** information theory, **John von Neumann's** stored-program architecture, and **Donald Knuth's** multi-volume 'The Art of Computer Programming' are all seminal works that have significantly contributed to the field of computation and algorithms. 

The classic algorithms, such as Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, Kruskal's and Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithms, and the Fast Fourier Transform, have been cornerstones in the development of efficient software systems. These algorithms have been instrumental in addressing complex computational problems in fields such as graph theory, signal processing, and network routing, among others.

As we moved further into the digital age, the second, third and fourth generation of computers brought significant advancements in computational power, size, and efficiency. The introduction of transistors, integrated circuits, and microprocessors paved the way for personal computers and eventually, the Internet. 

The current trends in computation and algorithms reflect a concerted move towards more intelligent and adaptive systems. Machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms are the front runners in this revolution. These algorithms, such as deep neural networks, reinforcement learning, and genetic algorithms, are capable of learning from data, making predictions, and even adapting their responses based on the feedback received. 

Quantum computing is another domain gaining significant attention. It proposes using quantum bits or qubits instead of the traditional binary bits. Algorithms for quantum computers, such as Shor's algorithm for integer factorization and Grover's algorithm for searching an unsorted database, promise exponential speed-ups over their classical counterparts.

The rise of big data has also fostered the development of new algorithms and data structures to handle and process massive volumes of data efficiently. MapReduce, a programming model for processing large data sets, and the NoSQL databases are examples of such developments.

The field of bioinformatics has given rise to a whole new class of algorithms that are specifically designed to deal with biological data. Algorithms like BLAST for sequence alignment and PhyML for phylogeny reconstruction are some of the many bioinformatics algorithms that are being used to understand genetic diseases, drug discovery, and other biological phenomena.

In conclusion, the journey of computation and algorithms from the classics to the modern trends is a testament to human ingenuity and the relentless pursuit of knowledge. While the classics laid a solid foundation and gave us the tools to understand and manipulate information, the new trends are pushing the boundaries of what's possible, paving the way for a future where intelligent machines, quantum computers, and sophisticated algorithms become the norm.

As we stand at the cusp of this exciting future, it is important to remember the journey that brought us here and the people who contributed to it. The evolving landscape of computation and algorithms is a reflection of the broader human endeavor to understand and shape the world around us. It is a journey that is as much about the past as it is about the future.
