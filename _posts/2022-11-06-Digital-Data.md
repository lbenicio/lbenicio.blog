# Digital Data


Data wasn't always important. If we look at the beginning of the digital age of our evolution, communications were open, there was no encryption or a concern to protect data. Old protocols, such as email, or even cellular communications, still suffer from legacy. The question that remains is why, at the beginning, did you not think about the consequences of the data being available there for those who want to access it without any kind of security? It's simple, when it all started, we couldn't imagine where we would be today, they didn't imagine our data analysis power and only now, with the advancement of computing power and the ability to mine this data that the scenario has changed.

With the recent advancement of technology, private companies and governments have been able to read, organize and process this volume of data and extract information. With that, the data became much more important and began to attract the concern of the average citizen. But by the time this issue came up to be evaluated and discussed it was too late, the framework was already in place and she didn't take it into account. Allied to the new interest in data and the high cost of changing the infrastructure, it becomes increasingly attractive to maintain an insecure structure.

And the problem is pervasive, for example, when a government takes a census and makes data publicly available, using statistical knowledge and with sufficient data it is possible to draw personal conclusions with respect to individuals and not just a population. The problem of privacy security, ownership of your data and how it is used is just beginning because the culture that data is worthless is intrinsic to the user, people don't care, the discourse that you have nothing to hiding is still very strong, which causes concern.

As highlighted in the lecture by doctoral student Anna Binotto, there are cases like the one reported by the New York Times, where the American police, for fear of a terrorist attack, were monitoring people's internet access. Under the guise of national security, they ended up breaking into the home of a woman who was researching arcuate pressure to cook food whose son was also researching the New York Marathon attacks. Situations like these continue to occur as public opinion supports the security discourse that the state must use all means to prevent chaos.

Finally, we need to organize the problem by parts and start by making the population aware of the importance of their data, of the existing tools capable of protecting them, ensuring that everyone gives due importance. So, for the near future, we can think about charging the state for ways to guarantee and protect the privacy of each individual as a person and guarantee the security of their data for when a company uses personal data, for example, there is a mechanism to verify and validate that the person is in good standing with the government but without handing over large amounts of data to private companies, including data not essential for their respective businesses.
