Java 8, which was released in 2014, is a major upgrade from Java 7 and offers many new features and improvements. In this essay, we will explore some of the key differences between Java 7 and Java 8, and why someone should study Java 8 instead of Java 7.

## Differences between java 7 and java 8

First and foremost, Java 8 introduced the concept of lambda expressions, which provide a way to write anonymous functions in a compact and readable form. Lambda expressions can be used to simplify complex code and make it more concise, making it easier to write, understand, and maintain.

Another major feature of Java 8 is the Stream API, which provides a powerful and flexible way to manipulate collections of data. With the Stream API, developers can perform operations on collections of data, such as filtering, mapping, and reducing, without having to write explicit loops or handle the underlying data structures themselves.

Java 8 also includes several new time and date APIs, which make it easier to work with time and date data. The new APIs provide a more intuitive and flexible way to perform operations on dates and times, such as parsing and formatting, as well as dealing with time zones and daylight savings.

Another important feature of Java 8 is the default method interface, which allows interfaces to provide default implementations of methods. This is useful for adding new methods to existing interfaces without breaking existing code that implements those interfaces.

In addition to these new features, Java 8 also includes a number of performance improvements, such as faster startup time and reduced memory overhead, which can make Java applications run faster and more efficiently.

On the other hand, Java 7 was released in 2011 and does not include these new features and improvements. While it is still a widely used version of Java, it is becoming increasingly outdated, and many developers are moving on to newer versions of Java, such as Java 8 and Java 11.

In conclusion, there are many reasons why someone should study Java 8 instead of Java 7. From the new features, such as lambda expressions and the Stream API, to the performance improvements, Java 8 provides a more modern and powerful way to develop Java applications. By learning Java 8, you will be better prepared for the future of Java development, and more able to write high-quality, efficient, and maintainable code.
