ECMAScript is the standardized scripting language that underlies JavaScript, one of the most popular programming languages in use today. ECMAScript is developed and maintained by the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) and is designed to provide a standardized, cross-platform language for scripting applications.

## Differences between ecma script 2019 and ecma script 2017

ECMAScript 2017, also known as ECMAScript 8, was released in June 2017 and brought several new features and improvements to the language. One of the key new features in ECMAScript 2017 was the addition of async and await, which provide a way to write asynchronous code in a more readable and manageable way. With async and await, developers can write asynchronous code that looks like synchronous code, making it easier to understand and debug.

Another important feature in ECMAScript 2017 was the introduction of shared memory and atomic operations, which allow multiple threads to access and update shared data structures in a safe and consistent manner. This makes it possible to write high-performance, concurrent applications in JavaScript, something that was not possible before.

ECMAScript 2019, also known as ECMAScript 11, was released in June 2019 and brought additional new features and improvements to the language. One of the key new features in ECMAScript 2019 was the addition of the Array.prototype.flat() and Array.prototype.flatMap() methods, which provide a more convenient and efficient way to flatten and map arrays.

Another important feature in ECMAScript 2019 was the introduction of optional catch binding, which allows developers to omit the catch variable if they do not need it. This makes it easier to write catch blocks that are focused only on the error handling logic, without having to declare and manage a catch variable.

In addition to these new features, ECMAScript 2019 also includes a number of performance improvements, such as faster startup time and reduced memory overhead, which can make JavaScript applications run faster and more efficiently.

In conclusion, ECMAScript is a powerful and widely used scripting language that underlies JavaScript. ECMAScript 2017 and ECMAScript 2019 are two of the latest versions of the language, and they both bring new features and improvements to the language. Whether you are an experienced JavaScript developer or just starting out, studying ECMAScript 2017 and ECMAScript 2019 is a great way to enhance your skills and improve the quality and efficiency of your code.
