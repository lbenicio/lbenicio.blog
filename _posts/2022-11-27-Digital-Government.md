# Digital Government

The digital transformation in governments talks about the use of technology to increase the engagement of the population in matters of a state nature. This can be achieved, for example, through digital platforms and systems to make data available to the population, hold referendums to find out the opinion of the population on a particular subject, or even to send suggestions. for state projects. Speaking of the digital transformation of a government, we are talking about the government as a platform. This digital government is based on six guidelines, which are based on proactive, user-driven, data-driven, digital by definition and, of course, open source for the population.

With the emergence of new technologies, new ways of organizing society, with the increasing complexity of problems, institutional crises began to emerge along with a demand and social pressure on governments and a way to begin to organize the problem that was emerging was through open government. We started our story with an analog, closed and internally focused government, often each agency had its own database and these were not synchronized. Over the years, we moved towards an electronic model, where transparency increased, approaches became more user-centric, procedures supported by ICTs, we started to solve the problem, although it was still the old “modus operandi” from the past just transferred to the digital medium. We are now in the third phase of this project, digital government, where we have more open and user-driven approaches, more procedural and operational transformations, through technology, to strengthen this link between citizen and state, transforming the “ modus operandi” of yesteryear in a new stage of evolution.

As shown in Danielle Bello's talk, “the transformation to digital government is an essential mechanism to institutionalize public policy objectives, align priorities and integrate coordinated actions. It sets out key requirements to enable efficient and effective implementation of public policies, to accompany the development of such policies and their results, and defines accountability mechanisms supported by the appropriate governance structure”. Also according to the same lecture, since 2000 this transformation has been happening, step by step, with small projects, laws and new institutions created focused on this transformation. All this is built using an agile methodology, focused on the user, prioritizing fast deliveries, transparency, privacy, ethics, integrity and, of course, with open source.

Finally, our government is in a transitional phase, at the beginning of the digital government era. We can divide this digital government creation wheel into three stages, development, where priority is given to the development of non-existent or inoperative systems such as People Management and Food, evolution, developing our functionalities and improvements in systems and existing applications and, finally, correction, with solutions for failures that make it difficult or unfeasible to use. Here it is worth remembering that this change has to be well planned and executed to avoid problems such as an incomplete transition, creation or strengthening of digital barriers and also protect the privacy of the people who use the service in question.
