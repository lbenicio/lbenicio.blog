Hi folks, today we are going to have a different post. We are going to talk about Internet and LGPD.

# Internet and LGPD

The internet emerged 50 years ago and with it a new world emerged, people treated it almost like a separate planet as if the laws didn't apply. You could do what you want and how you want, and many people fall into the false fallacy that it must be a free land. But here we encounter a first problem. If the internet is a free and unregulated place, like all the rest of the society in which we live, the companies that sell this product also have the freedom that the user and this is where the traps live.

Just as a user wants to be free to browse wherever he wants, say what he wants, do what he almost wants on the internet, a company can, for example, facilitate access to a certain online service to the detriment of another service, it can limit the services we access, guidelines that gained the common census in mid-2014. Here, regulation comes in as a need to organize things, set limits, or else we fall into the same paradox of a tolerant society. If we tolerate everything on the internet, intolerant subjects will emerge and use their powers to create an intolerant environment, and, in the same way, we would end up with an internet totally opposite to the ideal of freedom.

It is necessary to hold a user accountable for their online actions as well as their actions in the physical world, after all, for example, hate speech and instigation of violence is a crime, no matter where it is conveyed. Just like a company that provides a service to the consumer, or even a retailer, these companies need to follow regulations so as not to harm the consumer and the consumer cannot do what they want with the companies, there is a leveling. It is precisely in this vacuum of social organization that the Marco Civil da internet, or as it is known by our legislators, law number 12.965/2014 enters.

As discussed in the lecture by doctoral student Rafael Zanatta, as the market began to understand the value of the internet product, multiple strategies emerged to market this wonderful product that everyone wants, which ended up necessitating pioneering public policies in Brazil to protect this ecosystem. such as the LGPD, discussed by the speaker Mariana Rielli, and the Marco Civil da Internet. The LGPD addresses the issue of online privacy, data use and responsibilities, whereas Marco Civil legislates on the responsibilities and obligations of companies and people who use the internet, ensuring, for example, that content platforms are not held responsible. according to what was published there, net neutrality, where an internet access provider cannot privilege a certain traffic to the detriment of others.

Finally, the LGPD, together with the Marco Civil, are an important step by Brazil to regulate the internet. The discussion is not over yet and all issues have not yet been discussed. We are at the beginning of the internet and many scenarios will still appear, it is necessary to maintain the spirit of debate of the 2010s to organize this invention that we are still understanding why it works.
