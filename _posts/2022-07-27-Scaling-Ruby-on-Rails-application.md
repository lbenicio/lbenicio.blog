Now i will try a series of posts discussing performance increase on a Ruby on Rails application. To do so, we are going to use [Consul](https://github.com/consul/consul) as a sample application. In this first post, we are going to see the lab environment where the tests will the performed. Each batch of tests will be released on a week basis, after all posts have been releases, i will drop the raw files.
