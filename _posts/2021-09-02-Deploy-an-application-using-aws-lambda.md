AWS Lambda is a serverless computing platform that enables you to run your code without having to worry about infrastructure. In this blog post, we will learn how to deploy an application on AWS Lambda.
## Deploy an application using AWS Lambda

To deploy an application on AWS Lambda, you will need to have an AWS account and a basic understanding of AWS Lambda and AWS CloudFormation.

1. Create an AWS Lambda Function: The first step in deploying an application on AWS Lambda is to create an AWS Lambda function. You can do this through the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or AWS CloudFormation.

2. Package Your Application: To deploy your application on AWS Lambda, you will need to package your application and its dependencies into a ZIP file. You can do this by using the AWS CLI or by manually creating the ZIP file.

3. Upload Your Application to AWS Lambda: After packaging your application, you will need to upload your ZIP file to AWS Lambda. You can do this through the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or AWS CloudFormation.

4. Set Environment Variables: If your application requires any environment variables, you can set them in the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or AWS CloudFormation.

5. Set Up AWS Lambda Triggers: AWS Lambda functions can be triggered by events such as API Gateway requests, S3 bucket uploads, or CloudWatch events. You can set up these triggers in the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or AWS CloudFormation.

6. Test Your Application: After setting up your AWS Lambda function, you can test your application by using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or AWS CloudFormation. You can also use AWS X-Ray to debug your application if necessary.

7. Deploy Your Application: Once you have tested your application, you can deploy it by using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or AWS CloudFormation.


Deploying an application on AWS Lambda is a straightforward process that makes it easier for you to run your code without having to worry about infrastructure. With AWS Lambda, you can enjoy the benefits of serverless computing and focus on your application’s code. So, if you’re ready to start deploying your application on AWS Lambda, get started today!
