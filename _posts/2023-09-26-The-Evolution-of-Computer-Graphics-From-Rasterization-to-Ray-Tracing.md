# The Evolution of Computer Graphics: From Rasterization to Ray Tracing

## Introduction
Computer graphics have come a long way since the early days of simple wireframe models and pixelated images. Today, we are surrounded by stunning, realistic visuals in movies, video games, and virtual reality experiences. This evolution has been driven by advancements in computation and algorithms, particularly in the field of computer graphics. In this article, we will explore the journey of computer graphics from the traditional rasterization technique to the modern and highly realistic ray tracing method.

## Rasterization: The Birth of Computer Graphics
The field of computer graphics started with the advent of rasterization, a technique that converts geometric shapes into a grid of pixels. Rasterization allowed computers to display simple 2D images on screen, which was a revolutionary breakthrough at the time. The process involved dividing the screen into a grid and determining the color of each pixel based on the objects and lights in the scene.

Rasterization made real-time rendering possible, enabling applications such as video games and computer-aided design. However, it suffered from several limitations. One major drawback was the inability to accurately represent light interactions, resulting in flat and unrealistic images. This prompted researchers to develop more sophisticated methods to overcome these limitations.

## Phong Shading: Adding Realism to Rasterization
In the late 1970s, Bui Tuong Phong introduced a technique called Phong shading, which improved the visual quality of rasterized images by simulating the interaction of light with surfaces. Phong shading was a significant step towards realism in computer graphics. It introduced the concepts of ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting to simulate how light reflects off different materials.

Phong shading computed the color and intensity of each pixel by considering the surface normal, the direction of the light source, and the observer's position. This technique gave objects a sense of depth and made them appear more realistic. Phong shading became a cornerstone in computer graphics and is still used today in many applications.

## Texture Mapping: Adding Detail to Surfaces
While Phong shading improved the overall appearance of rasterized images, it still lacked the ability to represent intricate details on surfaces. This limitation led to the development of texture mapping, which allowed the application of images, called textures, onto the surfaces of 3D objects.

Texture mapping involves wrapping a 2D image around a 3D object, simulating the appearance of fine details and patterns. This technique added a level of realism that was previously unattainable with rasterization alone. Artists and designers could now create more visually appealing and detailed scenes by applying textures that mimicked real-world materials like wood, metal, or fabric.

## The Rise of Ray Tracing: A Paradigm Shift in Computer Graphics
Although rasterization with Phong shading and texture mapping paved the way for realistic computer graphics, they still fell short in accurately simulating light interactions. This limitation gave rise to a new paradigm in computer graphics called ray tracing.

Ray tracing is a rendering technique that simulates the physics of light by tracing the path of light rays as they interact with objects in a scene. Unlike rasterization, which calculates the color of each pixel independently, ray tracing considers the entire scene and calculates the color of each pixel based on the interaction of light with objects and surfaces.

Ray tracing revolutionized computer graphics by producing highly realistic images with accurate reflections, refractions, and shadows. However, the computational complexity of ray tracing made it impractical for real-time applications. Early ray tracing algorithms took hours or even days to render a single frame, limiting its use to pre-rendered scenes in movies and animations.

## Advancements in Computation: Enabling Real-Time Ray Tracing
As computational power increased over the years, real-time ray tracing became more feasible. Graphics processing units (GPUs) evolved to handle the massive parallelism required for ray tracing computations. In 2018, NVIDIA introduced dedicated ray tracing hardware with their RTX series of GPUs, further accelerating the adoption of real-time ray tracing.

Real-time ray tracing in modern applications like video games has become a reality, thanks to advancements in computation and algorithms. Game developers can now create immersive environments with realistic lighting and reflections, enhancing the overall visual experience for players.

## Conclusion
The evolution of computer graphics from rasterization to ray tracing has been a fascinating journey. Starting from simple wireframe models, we have witnessed the development of techniques like Phong shading and texture mapping that added realism and detail to rasterized images. However, it was the introduction of ray tracing that truly revolutionized computer graphics, enabling highly realistic visuals with accurate light interactions.

Advancements in computation, particularly the increased processing power of GPUs, have made real-time ray tracing a reality. Today, we can enjoy lifelike graphics in video games, movies, and virtual reality experiences. As technology continues to evolve, we can expect further advancements in computer graphics, pushing the boundaries of realism and immersion even further.
