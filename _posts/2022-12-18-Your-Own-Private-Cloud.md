Following previous week post, we will have, also, a small post about a list to build your own personal cloud. The idea here is using free resource to create a small cloud cluster to deploy small projects and study System Admin (SysAdmin) and System Operations (SysOps).

Cutting to the point, we have two options, Docker Swarm, and K3s. You can think of a Docker Swarm cluster like a giant docker environment built upon various machines. K3s is the similar approach, but for Kubernetes. The difference here is that K3s is a smaller build, made for that kind of small environment.

# Cloud Resources

### Docker Swarm Rocks

Docker Swarm is a container orchestration tool built in docker, here is a couple of resources explaining it:

[https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/)

[https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/)

Here is a great start point for building your own cluster using Docker Swarm:

### K3s Rocks

K3s is a version of Kubernetes, as known as, K8s, which also is a container orchestration tool. THe idea behind the name of K3s was that it was a smaller version of "K8s".

Also, as for DOcker Swarm, here is a great starting point for building your own cluster using K3s:

# Conclusion

That its folks! Thank you for following up until here, and if you have any question or just want to chat, send me a message on GitHub of this project or an email. Am I doing it right? Was it a good hello world post for the blogging community?
