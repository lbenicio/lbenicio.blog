## What is better serverless of classic

Serverless architecture refers to a way of building and running applications and services without having to worry about infrastructure. Instead of managing servers or infrastructure, you can simply write and deploy your code and let the cloud provider handle the rest.

There are several reasons why serverless architecture is a great choice for hobby developers and pet projects.

First, it can save you time and hassle. With serverless architecture, you don't have to worry about setting up servers, configuring them, or maintaining them. This can be especially helpful if you don't have a lot of experience with infrastructure management.

Second, it can save you money. Because you only pay for the resources you use, serverless architecture can be more cost-effective than running your own servers, especially for small projects.

Third, it can allow you to focus on what you love: writing code. With serverless architecture, you can spend more time developing your application and less time worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

Fourth, it can make it easier to scale your application. With serverless architecture, you don't have to worry about capacity planning or adding more servers to handle increased traffic. The cloud provider will automatically scale your application to meet demand.

Fifth, it can make it easier to collaborate with others. Serverless architectures often come with built-in version control and collaboration tools, which can make it easier to work with others on your project.

Sixth, it can make it easier to deploy your application. With serverless architecture, you can often deploy your code with a single command or click, rather than having to worry about setting up a deployment pipeline.

Seventh, it can make it easier to integrate with other services and APIs. Many serverless architectures come with pre-built integrations with popular services, which can make it easier to add functionality to your application.

Eighth, it can make it easier to test your application. Serverless architectures often come with built-in testing and debugging tools, which can make it easier to identify and fix issues with your code.

Ninth, it can make it easier to experiment with new technologies. Because serverless architectures allow you to focus on writing code, you can use them as a playground for trying out new technologies and approaches without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

Overall, serverless architecture is a great choice for hobby developers and pet projects. It can save you time, money, and hassle, and allow you to focus on what you love: writing code. With the many benefits it offers, it's no wonder that serverless architecture is becoming increasingly popular among developers of all levels.
