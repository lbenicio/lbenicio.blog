AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a scalable and reliable object storage service that makes it easy to host and serve static websites. In this blog post, we will learn how to deploy a static website using AWS S3.

## Deploy and application using AWS S3

To deploy a static website using AWS S3, you will need to have an AWS account, a basic understanding of AWS S3, and the content of your website.

1. Create an S3 Bucket: The first step in deploying a static website using AWS S3 is to create an S3 bucket. You can do this through the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or AWS CloudFormation.

2. Configure Bucket for Static Website Hosting: To host a static website using AWS S3, you will need to configure your S3 bucket for static website hosting. You can do this through the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or AWS CloudFormation.

3. Upload Website Content: After configuring your S3 bucket for static website hosting, you will need to upload the content of your website to your S3 bucket. You can do this through the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or AWS CloudFormation.

4. Set Bucket Policy: To make your website publicly accessible, you will need to set a bucket policy that allows public read access to your S3 bucket. You can do this through the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or AWS CloudFormation.

5. Create a Custom Domain Name: If you want to use a custom domain name for your website, you will need to create a custom domain name and configure it to point to your S3 bucket. You can do this through Amazon Route 53.

6. Enable HTTPS: To ensure the security of your website and its users, you will need to enable HTTPS for your website. You can do this by using Amazon Certificate Manager to request and install an SSL/TLS certificate.

7. Test Your Website: After completing the above steps, you can test your website by accessing it through the S3 bucket's URL or through your custom domain name.
